HERO(GRAPHS)
==============

An educational math game that exercises users' ability to construct graphs.

Progress from level to level by shooting a cannonball at the opponent; the path that the cannonball travels in is determined by the piecewise function you enter.

1. Launch home.html; wait for the network to be set up, and for the controller link to appear.

2. Either open the controller link, or open the dictated URL on any Internet-enabled device.  The URL leads to the controller, allowing the game to be "remote controlled" from an external device if desired.

3. Wait for the controller to report to being connected.

4. Choose a game difficulty and wait for the game screen to launch.

5. Type in the equation on the controller.  Piecewise functions can be constructed by pressing "Add", and adjusting the bounds displayed after the equation.

6. Press "Go" to shoot the cannonball!
